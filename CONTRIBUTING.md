The general message is that most development occurs in Continue.

We do track upstream bugs, UI improvements, and features
that we think are relevant for Granite.Code.
See the [Issues for this repository](https://github.com/Granite-Code/granite-code/issues).

If you are working on one of those,
please feel to ask questions on the issue,
and if you submit a PR, please put a link to it in the issue,
and we can help review.

To run upstream Continue
with the same models and other configuration that Granite.Code uses,
use the "Granite.Code: write Continue config" command.
